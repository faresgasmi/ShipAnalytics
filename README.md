<h1>Genmar – AI & BI Marine Analytics Platform</h1>
<h2>📝 Overview</h2>

Genmar is an advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Business Intelligence (BI) project designed to assist port authorities and maritime companies in automating document extraction, predicting ship metrics, detecting anomalies, and identifying damages through computer vision.

This project integrates multiple AI models and an interactive dashboard built with Streamlit, providing an all-in-one solution for maritime data analysis and automation.

Main Objectives:

Automate data extraction from PDF invoices using OCR

Predict Gross Tonnage (GT) and Average Port Time for vessels

Detect operational anomalies in ships using ML

Identify container or ship damages with YOLOv9

Visualize and monitor key KPIs via a BI dashboard

<h2>🚀 Key Features</h2>
<h3>📄 Automated PDF Invoice Extraction (OCR)</h3>

Uses PDFPlumber to extract structured data from invoices automatically.

Extracts fields like Invoice Number, Type, Debarquement + Dépotage, Fret Charges, Magasinage, and more.

Exports clean data to Excel format for financial and logistics analysis.

<h3>⚙️ Gross Tonnage (GT) Prediction</h3>

Predicts the GT (Gross Tonnage) of a vessel using a pre-trained regression model (modele_gt.pkl).

Input features: Length, Width, and Deadweight (DWT).

Helps estimate vessel capacity for port operations.

<h3>⏱️ Average Port Time Prediction</h3>

Predicts the average stay time of ships in port using a Random Forest regression model (rf_model_port.pkl).

Inputs: Length, DWT, and Maximum Capacity.

Data normalized using scaler.pkl for consistent results.

<h3>⚠️ Anomaly Detection (AIS Data)</h3>

Detects anomalous ship behavior (e.g., abnormal navigation patterns).

Uses Isolation Forest trained on vessel navigation and physical data.

Encodes categorical features (Ship Type, Navigational Status) using One-Hot Encoding (columns_after_ohe.pkl).

Output: 🚨 Anomaly detected or ✅ Normal ship behavior.

<h3>📷 Damage Detection with YOLOv9</h3>

Integrates a YOLOv9 model (best.pt) to detect visible damages on containers or ships.

Runs inference directly in Streamlit and displays annotated detection results.

Useful for automating visual inspection during port entry.

<h3>📊 BI Dashboard & Analytics</h3>

Built-in dashboard in Streamlit to visualize key performance indicators:

Average unloading and loading times

Total freight costs (TND, USD, EUR)

Anomalies per ship type

Damage detection statistics

Combines AI predictions and business data for operational decision-making.
